# Trash Chute

![Game Preview](/public/img/game-preview.webp)

Make it to the top of the trash chute while avoiding the bits of trash sliding down towards you.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Multiplayer

Aiming to have multiplayer via P2P and Websockets. Websocket backend code is not in this repo or available at this time. P2P code will be included here.

## Inspiration

Inspired by the many games that have introduced this as a mini game, most notable being Halo 3 custom games.
